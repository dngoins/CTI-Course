# Check It Out 05: Cyber Espionage Campaigns and WannaCry Ransomware
## Student Lab Manual

### Lab Scenario

You are a newly onboarded Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analyst at a security operations center. As part of your orientation, your supervisor assigns you a research task to explore the high-profile **Cyber Espionage Campaigns** and the **WannaCry Ransomware Attack** of 2017. This exercise aims to enhance your understanding of how CTI plays a pivotal role in mitigating threats and preventing such attacks in the future. 

Your investigation will focus on the threat environments associated with these incidents, with a focus on the attackersâ€™ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), the actors involved, and the impact of these attacks.

### Lab Objectives

Conduct a focused web search on **Cyber Espionage Campaigns** (e.g., APT28, APT29) and the **WannaCry Ransomware Attack**. Your goal is to understand: 

- The role of CTI in identifying and mitigating these threats
- The techniques used by the attackers
- The origin and motivation behind the attacks
- The vulnerabilities or missteps exploited in the attacks
- The lessons learned and how organizations can improve their defenses

### Description

Using Google, Bing, or a trusted threat intelligence platform, search for credible sources (e.g., news articles, cybersecurity blogs, official reports) on **Cyber Espionage Campaigns** and **WannaCry Ransomware**. Pay close attention to:

- The attackers involved in each campaign and their motives (e.g., nation-state actors, financially motivated threat groups)
- The specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used
- How the vulnerabilities exploited by the attackers were discovered and leveraged
- The overall impact of the incidents and how organizations responded
- Key takeaways and recommendations for mitigating similar threats in the future

Be prepared to share:

- A short summary of each attack/campaign
- A detailed analysis of the tactics and techniques used by the attackers
- Lessons learned and best practices to defend against such attacks

#### Estimated Timing: 10 minutes

This activity will help build your understanding of the complex nature of cyber threats and how threat intelligence is crucial for identifying, mitigating, and responding to these threats.
