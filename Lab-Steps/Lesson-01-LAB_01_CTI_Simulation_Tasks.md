# LAB 01: Cyber Threat Intelligence Simulation

## Objective

In this lab, students will simulate a real-world cyber threat scenario and apply foundational Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) concepts. Working in teams, they will identify a security breach, analyze potential threat actors, and develop strategic mitigation plans using open-source and critical thinking techniques.

---

## Prerequisites

Students should have completed the introductory CTI lessons and understand basic cybersecurity principles including:

- The intelligence cycle (direction, collection, processing, analysis, dissemination)
- TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) of threat actors
- The value of open-source intelligence (OSINT)
- Basic knowledge of threat modeling

## Scenario

An unknown hacker group has breached the Ministry of Defense (MOD)‚Äôs location systems for individual users. Your task is to work in "tiger teams" to investigate this breach, identify threat vectors, assess attacker intent, and develop a defensive strategy to protect key MOD assets.

In your tiger team, answer the following questions:
1. What immediate steps would you take to identify the breach?
2. Who do you think the attackers are? What are their motivations?
3. What attack vectors might they have used?
4. What are the two most critical assets in the MOD lab environment? Why?
5. What defensive strategies would you implement to protect these assets?
6. How would you prioritize these strategies?
7. What open-source tools would you use to gather intelligence on this breach?
8. How would you document your findings and strategies for future reference?

## Lab Setup

### Materials Needed

- Computers with internet access
- OneNote or digital notebook (e.g., "Day 1 ‚Äì My First Hunt")
- Whiteboard or digital collaboration tools (e.g., Jamboard, Miro)

### Duration

25‚Äì30 minutes total

## Instructions

### üïê Task 1: Introduction (5 Minutes)

**Steps:**

1.1 Instructor briefs students on the MOD breach scenario.  
1.2 Highlight the importance of CTI in understanding and mitigating real-world threats.  
1.3 Divide the class into tiger teams (4‚Äì5 students per group).  
1.4 Explain that this exercise assesses their instinctive responses; tools and frameworks will be introduced later in the course.

### üîç Task 2: Threat Identification (5 Minutes)

**Objective:** Begin by identifying the breach and gathering initial intelligence.

**Steps:**

2.1 Each team documents their immediate response steps.  
2.2 Encourage use of OSINT tools such as Google, Shodan, and public breach databases.  
2.3 Capture initial thoughts, actions, and any indicators of compromise (IoCs).  
2.4 Record all findings in their Day 1 worksheet under a section titled **‚ÄúThreat Identification.‚Äù**

---

### üß† Task 3: Threat Analysis (5 Minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze the breach data to understand the threat actor's intent and methods.

**Steps:**

3.1 Hypothesize who the attackers might be (e.g., based on regional motives, APT group behaviors).  
3.2 Document likely motivations (e.g., espionage, disruption, data theft).  
3.3 Discuss and write down potential attack vectors used in the breach (e.g., phishing, privilege escalation).  
3.4 Develop a basic **threat profile** summarizing TTPs and actor motivations.  
3.5 Log all findings in the Day 1 document under **‚ÄúThreat Analysis.‚Äù**

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Task 4: Strategy Formulation (10 Minutes)

**Objective:** Develop mitigation strategies to defend the MOD systems.

**Steps:**

4.1 Identify the two most critical assets in the MOD lab environment.  
4.2 Justify why they are critical.  
4.3 Design defensive strategies to protect these assets.  
4.4 Include proactive measures (e.g., threat hunting, network segmentation).  
4.5 Record strategies in the Day 1 worksheet under **‚ÄúStrategy Formulation.‚Äù**

---

### üì£ Task 5: Team Presentations & Discussion (5 Minutes)

**Objective:** Share team findings and promote cross-team collaboration.

**Steps:**

5.1 Prepare a short presentation covering identification, analysis, and mitigation steps.  
5.2 Present to the class, followed by open discussion.  
5.3 Instructor provides feedback and introduces alternative perspectives.  

---

### ‚úÖ Task 6: Conclusion (5 Minutes)

**Steps:**

6.1 Summarize CTI‚Äôs role in this simulated breach.  
6.2 Highlight how student instincts compared to established best practices.  
6.3 Reinforce the themes of:
  - **Proactive Defense**
  - **Informed Decision-Making**
  - **Collaboration & Information Sharing**  
6.4 Explain that upcoming labs will introduce tooling and automation to support CTI workflows.

## Key Takeaways

- CTI is essential to understanding adversary behavior.
- Open-source tools provide valuable early-stage intelligence.
- Team-based collaboration enriches analysis and enhances defensive strategies.
- Structured analysis leads to informed, proactive defense planning.
