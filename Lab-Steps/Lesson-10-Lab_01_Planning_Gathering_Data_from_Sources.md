# LAB 10: Planning and Gathering Data from Threat Intelligence Sources

## Objective

This lab reinforces the concepts of planning and gathering data from threat intelligence sources. The focus will be on utilizing Google Dorks for OSINT and Nessus for vulnerability scanning, specifically targeting the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT28) group. Students will apply these techniques using a sample dataset for analysis.

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with the basics of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and possess foundational knowledge of:

- The intelligence cycle (Planning, Gathering, Analysis, Dissemination)
- Google Dorks and its use in OSINT
- Vulnerability scanning tools such as Nessus

---

## Lab Setup

### Materials Needed

- Computers with internet access
- Kali Linux virtual machine (username: kali, password: kali)
- Google Dorks queries
- Nessus vulnerability scanning tool
- Sample dataset (ADFA Intrusion Detection Datasets)

### Duration

Approximately 90 minutes

### üß† Task 2: Planning Phase (20 Minutes)

**Objective:** Plan the intelligence gathering process by identifying key requirements and resources.

**Steps:**

2.1 **Identifying Intelligence Requirements:**  
   - Define what information is needed, such as potential threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors related to APT28.  
   - Example: Identify TTPs of APT28 targeting the financial sector.  

2.2 **Setting Objectives:**  
   - Define clear and measurable goals.  
   - Example: Identify specific attack vectors and tools used by APT28.

2.3 **Resource Allocation:**  
   - Allocate necessary resources including personnel, tools (Google Dorks, Nessus), and datasets.  

2.4 **Developing a Collection Plan:**  
   - Outline methods and sources for gathering intelligence (OSINT, TECHINT).  
   - Methods could include Google Dorks queries for OSINT and Nessus for vulnerability scanning.

### üîç Task 3: Gathering Phase (30 Minutes)

**Objective:** Gather data using OSINT and TECHINT techniques.

**Steps:**

3.1 **OSINT with Google Dorks:**  
   - Introduction to Google Dorks and how it can be used for OSINT.  
   - Example queries for APT28 investigation:  
   - `site:pastebin.com APT28`  
   - `intitle:"APT28" filetype:pdf`  
   - `inurl:APT28 report`
   - `related:apt28.com`
   - `intext:"APT28" "vulnerability"`
   - `filetype:docx "APT28" "attack vector"`
   - `ext:pdf "APT28" "TTPs"`
   - `cache:apt28.com`
   - `before:2023-01-01 APT28`
   - `after:2022-01-01 APT28`
   - Operators: `AND` `&`, `OR` `|`, `NOT`, `*` (wildcard), `..` (range), etc.
   

3.2 **Practical Exercise:**  
   - Use Google Dorks to gather publicly available data related to APT28.  
   - Document findings in the "OSINT Findings" section of the worksheet.

3.3 **Evaluating Credibility and Reliability:**  
   - Assess the credibility of the sources (authoritative vs non-authoritative).  
   - Cross-reference information and check the reputation of the sources.

3.4 **TECHINT with Nessus:**  
   - Introduction to Nessus and how it is used for vulnerability scanning.  
   - Setup and configuration of Nessus for scanning.
   - Navigate to [Trial Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/try#expert) and create an account if needed.
   - Nessus is installed on the Kali Linux VM, however it's trial version has not been activated yet.

3.5 **Practical Exercise:**  
   - Launch Kali Linux and open Nessus. Open the Nessus web interface in a browser (usually `https://localhost:8834`).  
   - Import the sample dataset (e.g., ADFA Intrusion Detection Datasets) into Nessus.  
   - The sample dataset can be found in your Downloads folder ~/Downloads/ADFA-IDS_datasets.zip
   - Unzip the dataset and import it into Nessus.
   - Configure the scan settings (e.g., scan type, target IPs, etc.).
   - Run a vulnerability scan on the dataset and analyze the results.  
   - Ensure the trial version of Nessus is activated to access all features.

### üìä Task 4: Analysis and Reporting (20 Minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze the collected data, identify patterns, and create a report.

**Steps:**

4.1 **Analyze the Collected Data:**  
   - Identify any patterns or correlations between the OSINT data and vulnerabilities identified by Nessus.  

4.2 **Reporting Findings:**  
   - Create a report summarizing the findings. Include key threats, vulnerabilities, and insights gained from the OSINT and TECHINT phases.  
   - Present recommendations for mitigating identified threats.

---

### üì£ Task 5: Discussion and Q&A (10 Minutes)

**Objective:** Review the results of the lab, discuss findings, and address questions.

**Steps:**

5.1 Each team presents their findings, highlighting the identified threats and vulnerabilities.  
5.2 Discuss the use of OSINT and TECHINT tools in the context of real-world cyber threat intelligence.  
5.3 Instructor provides feedback and answers any questions.
