# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You are a newly onboarded Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analyst at a security operations center. As part of your orientation, your supervisor assigns you a quick research task to explore prominent cyber threat groups and malware campaigns. This exercise is designed to develop your understanding of CTI at the **strategic level**, focusing on identifying nation-state threat actors, motivations, long-term impacts, and the strategic responses needed to defend against such adversaries.

## Lab objectives

Conduct a focused web search on the **Lazarus Group** and **Emotet malware**. Your goal is to understand:
- The strategic-level role of CTI in understanding and mitigating these threats
- The origin, motivation, and affiliations of the Lazarus Group and Emotet operators
- The techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) employed in major campaigns
- The long-term impact of these attacks on national security, financial systems, and critical infrastructure
- Governmental and industry responses and their strategic implications

### **Description**

Using Google or Bing, search for credible sources (threat intelligence reports, government advisories, news articles, and security vendor blogs) on the **Lazarus Group** and **Emotet malware** campaigns. Pay special attention to their geopolitical context, funding sources, and sustained impacts over time.

Be prepared to discuss and share:
- A short strategic summary of each threat  
- The actor’s or malware’s origin, motivation, and affiliations  
- Strategic-level implications of the attacks (e.g., on financial stability, defense posture, international relations)  
- High-level responses and policy changes that emerged  

#### Estimated timing: 10 minutes

This activity will help build your strategic threat analysis skills as we explore how CTI informs executive decision-making and national cybersecurity strategy in later modules.
