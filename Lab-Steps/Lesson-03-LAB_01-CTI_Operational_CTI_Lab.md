## Instructions

### üïê Task 1: Introduction to Operational CTI (5 minutes)

**Steps:**

1.1 Instructor provides an overview of Operational CTI, emphasizing its role in day-to-day decision-making, prioritizing resources, and defining security measures.  
1.2 Key points to cover:  
- Definition of Operational CTI  
- Examples of deliverables (e.g., CVEs, threat actor tactics)  
- Importance in vulnerability management and incident response  

---

### üîç Task 2: Discussion on CTI Utilization (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Discuss how Operational CTI is applied to real-world scenarios.

**Steps:**

2.1 Divide students into small groups (3‚Äì4 students per group).  
2.2 Groups discuss the following questions:
- How can daily threat briefings help in prioritizing security measures?
- What role does CTI play in incident response and vulnerability management?
- How can organizations use CTI to monitor hostile entities and protect critical infrastructure?  
2.3 Each group shares a summary of their discussion with the class.

### üß† Task 3: Malware Identification Techniques (15 minutes)

**Objective:** Understand the various techniques used to identify malware.

**Steps:**

3.1 Instructor provides an overview of the following malware identification techniques:
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):** Domain names, file hashes, IP addresses  
- **Signature-based Detection:** Matching known malware signatures  
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Observing abnormal behavior patterns  
- **Heuristic Methods:** Using algorithms to detect new, unknown malware  

3.2 Discuss how each method can be applied in real-world malware detection.  
3.3 Introduce the concept of leveraging CTI tools for each detection method.

### üõ°Ô∏è Task 4: Group Activity: Analyzing a Malware Incident (20 minutes)

**Objective:** Analyze a malware incident using CTI reports.

**Steps:**

4.1 Provide each group with one of the four malware analysis reports listed below (ensure they only have the report and not the findings):  
- [1] CISA Releases Malware Analysis Report on RESURGE Malware Associated ...
- [2] MAR-25993211-r1.v1 Ivanti Connect Secure (RESURGE) - CISA  
- [3] Malware Analysis Report 2025-03-28 - CISA  
- [4] Malware analysis: decoding Emotet, part 1 | Malwarebytes Labs  

4.2 Groups should follow these steps:  
- Review the provided malware analysis report.  
- Identify the CTI tools used.  
- Identify the malware type and its behavior.  
- Identify any CVEs mentioned.  
- Discuss findings and propose mitigation strategies.  

4.3 Record findings in a collaborative document for group sharing.

---

### üì£ Task 5: Group Presentations & Discussion (10 minutes)

**Objective:** Share findings and promote class-wide learning.

**Steps:**

5.1 Each group presents their analysis, findings, and proposed mitigation strategies to the class.  
5.2 Encourage class-wide discussion after each presentation.  
5.3 Instructor provides feedback and encourages cross-group analysis and perspectives.

### ‚úÖ Task 6: Wrap-Up and Reflection (2 minutes)

**Steps:**

6.1 Summarize the importance of Operational CTI in identifying and mitigating malware threats.  
6.2 Discuss how CTI tools supported the analysis and identification process.  
6.3 Reflection Questions for the class:  
- What challenges did you face during the malware analysis?  
- How did CTI tools assist in identifying and mitigating the malware threat?  
- How can organizations improve their use of Operational CTI?  
6.4 Explain that upcoming labs will delve into specific CTI tools and their integration into cybersecurity workflows.
