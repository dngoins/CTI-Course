# Check It Out 03: Cyber Threat Intelligence at Operational Level

## Student lab manual

### Lab scenario

You are a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analyst in a dynamic security operations center (SOC). Recently, there has been increased activity from sophisticated threats. Your supervisor tasks you with investigating two prominent threat actors: **Emotet malware** and **Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT29), also known as Cozy Bear**. This lab activity is aimed at enhancing your practical skills in operational-level CTI by exploring current malware threats and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

### Lab objectives

Conduct detailed research on **Emotet malware** and **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**. Your goal is to:

- Identify operational-level indicators and characteristics of each threat.
- Understand the threat actors' motivations, techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs).
- Assess how Emotet and APT29 operate within a targeted environment.
- Analyze operational-level CTI strategies to detect, prevent, and mitigate these threats.

### Description

Perform online research using credible cybersecurity sources (such as cybersecurity blogs, reputable news outlets, official cybersecurity incident reports, threat intelligence databases, and vendor-specific reports). Your analysis should focus on:

- Detailed profiles of Emotet malware and APT29.
- Typical infection vectors, attack chains, and vulnerabilities exploited by these threats.
- Specific operational-level indicators (IP addresses, domains, malware hashes, phishing email characteristics, etc.).
- Current detection, prevention, and response recommendations specific to operational CTI.

Prepare your findings in a concise and structured manner, ready to discuss the following points:

- Brief overview of Emotet malware and APT29 (Cozy Bear).
- Operational-level indicators that can be leveraged by SOC analysts.
- Key operational-level CTI strategies and best practices derived from your analysis.

#### Estimated timing: 15 minutes

This practical research activity will solidify your operational threat intelligence analysis capabilities, setting the stage for deeper strategic and tactical CTI exploration in subsequent modules.
