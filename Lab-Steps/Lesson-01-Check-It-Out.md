# Check It Out 01: Don't Believe Me, Check It Out
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You are a newly onboarded Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analyst at a security operations center. As part of your orientation, your supervisor assigns you a quick research task to explore major cyber attacks from the past. This exercise is designed to sharpen your investigative instincts and help you recognize the importance of identifying the role of CTI in these atacks as well as the root causes behind large-scale cyber incidents. 


## Lab objectives

Conduct a focused web search on the **Shamoon 2012 attack** and **Operation Ababil**. Your goal is to understand:
- The role of CTI in these attacks
- The origin and motivation behind the attacks
- The techniques used by the attackers
- The root causes that allowed the attacks to succeed
- How organizations responded and what was learned

### **Description**

Using Google or Bing, search for credible sources (news articles, cybersecurity blogs, official reports) on the **Shamoon 2012 attack** and **Operation Ababil**. Pay close attention to the threat actors involved, the vulnerabilities or missteps exploited, and the broader implications of each event.

Be prepared to discuss and share:
- A short summary of each attack  
- The primary cause or weakness that led to the incident  
- Key lessons learned or recommendations that emerged  


#### Estimated timing: 15 minutes

This activity will help build your analytical foundation as we move into structured CTI gathering and analysis in later modules.
